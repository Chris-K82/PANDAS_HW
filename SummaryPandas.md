```python
While using Pandas library we came across various commands. Right from the file reading to the exploraing the data
we did many operations on the dataframe. The commands such as renamimg the column name, determing the longest movies
arranging the data etc provide a good insight to the operations we are doing. The ways to perform the operations are
different for each of us. There are consice ways as well as elaborate way. Going through the commands done by each of
us we can see how big and versatile the support system of python. The another important feature is that while doing 
mathematical operation you can just give commands and do not have to give full defination of the operation. Also I 
like the info and insull().sum() feature as well. You can understand the different types of data types you have
also the NaN feature that could be very useful while playing with the columns.
